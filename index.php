            <h2>A little about me!</h2>
            <p>My name is Gina Noel. I am currently a full-time student improving my HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript skills! I have been in the software industry for roughly 22 years. I started out in support and moved into software testing when I logged more bugs than their current testers. From there I moved into an SDET roll writing mostly Java code for an android API. I also have experience in JavaScript using some basic HTML + CSS pages for automation. My extensive knowledge expands in all stages of software development from frontend to backend after many years in the field.</p>
            <p>I have a wide range of things I love to do. Some of my favorite activities would include yoga, travel, adventure, bike riding, hiking, knitting and writing code.</p>
            <p>I am also a certified yoga instructor. I would say my favorite yoga to teach is power yoga or vinyasa flow yoga. I have been teaching yoga for roughly 3 years and prefer outdoor yoga in beautiful locations with close friends. I someday hope to come up with that perfect yoga business name!</p>
            <p>One of my top passions is travel. My partner in crime, kitty cat and I currently live out of our RV named Marigold. We have lived in Marigold for 3 years now and we couldn't see ourselves doing anything else. I feel that this adventurous side showcases my ability to be flexible and adaptable to any situation. Can one say, can do attitude?</p>
            <p>My top passion has always been software development and working with others!</p>
