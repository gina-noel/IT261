            <h1>About Gina Noel</h1>
            <p>A little about me!</p>
            <p>My name is Gina Noel. I am currently a full-time student improving my HTML skills! I have been in the software industry for roughly 22 years.</p>
            <p>I have a wide range of things I love to do. Some of my favorite activities would include yoga, travel, adventure, bike riding, hiking, knitting and writing code.</p>
            <p>I am also a certified yoga instructor. I would say my favorite yoga to teach is power yoga or vinyasa flow yoga. I have been teaching yoga for roughly 2 years and prefer outdoor yoga in beautiful locations with close friends. I someday hope to come up with that perfect yoga business name!</p>
